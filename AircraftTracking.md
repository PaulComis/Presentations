# Aircraft Tracking
## Using Raspberry Pi and Software Defined Radio

## Paul Comis



# What this talk is all about
- A litte about me and my background
- Building an aircraft tracker (the MVP)
- Demo
- Retrospective (What I've Learned)
- What to do next



# About Me
- I work as a Technologist @ DXC.Technology
  - So in know my way around an xnix command line
- I like planes #avgeek
- I have an intermediate Amatuer Radio license (2E1BHC)
  - But haven't operated in many, many years


# The basic system



# Demo

# What I've Learned



# What's Next
- Optimise the Antenna placement
  - Ruggedise the Raspberry Pi, so it can go outside
  - Reduce the radio cable run as much as possible

- Optimise the Antenna
  - can be optimised for 1090 MHz
  - a discone?
  - or colinear?

- More Antennas?

- FlightAware reciever?



# Thank You!
